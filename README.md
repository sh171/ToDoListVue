# To Do List

## Overview
This is a simple to do list app using Vue.

## Description
- Create Feature
This feature allows for text input from a textbox. Upon pressing the create button, a TODO with the entered text information is saved. TODO data will be stored in an array, with the entered text being the value of the text property. If there is no text input, the create button should be disabled to prevent the creation of a new TODO. After creating a TODO, the input form is cleared. Once created, the TODO should be displayed in the TODO list on the screen.

- List Feature
This feature displays the created TODOs in a list format on the screen. Each TODO have a title like "TODO1," indicating its sequence in the list. Each TODO display the value of its stored text property as its content. If there are no TODOs, the screen display a message such as "There are no TODOs yet" instead of the TODO list.

- Delete Feature
A delete button should be placed on each displayed TODO card. Pressing the delete button will remove the corresponding TODO from the TODO list, and it will no longer be displayed in the list.
